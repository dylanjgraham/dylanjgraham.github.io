  <h1>Concept</h1>
  <p>  
     The idea behind this project was to create a proceduraly created series of points that then leave a trail when the camera 
    is moved. It was based off of a three.js example but I changed the points to be a particle system and created my own for loop
    to randomly place them around the screen
  </p>

<h1> Implementation decisions </h1>
<p> I started out this project creating points on the 3d cordinate plane and moving the camera around to force them to show their
trail. After procedurally implementing that I decided to add a particle system. I learned right away that my particles could 
be set up in a way that would would similarly to the points I was originally creating. So, I modified the code to create points
randomly on the grid given some params and had the rays generated that way.  </p>

  <h1>Roadblocks</h1>
  <p>
    <h3>CORS Exception</h2>
    One issue I ran into along the way was coming to a CORS exeption. To work around this I was forced to create a local http 
connection using python in the command line to test my program
  </p>
  <h3>GithubPage</h2>
    <p>
      I had trouble creating my github page. For some reason it was giving me a 404 error when I clicked the link. After changing
      nothing the next morning the link majically started working so I attribute the error so githubs side of thins
   </p>
  <h3>Rotation Issue</h2>
    <p>
      getting the camera to rotate at a fixed interval was challenging but eventually acomplished by incrementing the x value of
      the camera by 10 instead of just moving based off of user input.

  <h1> Effects Used </h1>
    <p>
    - Procedural implementation
    - user input in the form of mouse movement
    - Particle System
