<h1> Implementation decisions </h1>
<p> I started out this project creating points on the 3d cordinate plane and moving the camera around to force them to show their
trail. After procedurally implementing that I decided to add a particle system. I learned right away that my particles could 
be set up in a way that would would similarly to the points I was originally creating. So, I modified the code to create points
randomly on the grid given some params and had the rays generated that way.  </p>
